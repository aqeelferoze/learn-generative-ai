## The Future of Generative AI

“AI will be the greatest wealth creator in history because artificial intelligence doesn’t care where you were born, whether you have money, whether you have a PhD,” Higgins tells CNBC Make It. “It’s going to destroy barriers that have prevented people from moving up the ladder, and pursuing their dream of economic freedom.”

It’s already valued at almost $100 billion, and expected to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.

“It’s not that if you don’t jump on it now, you never can,” Higgins says. “It’s that now is the greatest opportunity for you to capitalize on it.”
